One thing I don't enjoy about Python tutorials and a lot of Python code out there is the overuse of variable names that sounds like they could be built-in or required names. It's __far__ better to use a name that is obviously a variable name, even if it's as clich√© as `my_varname`. This removes confusion. Various parts of this code have been change to that end, and to incorporate things I prefer, as well as some notes added in my current style of writing within, or appending to one large `NOTES` string variable.
