### Downloaded Pieces

Chance are that if you think of something to code, it's been coded already.

The was the case for this fusion helper.

While I don't currently know JavaScript, TypeScript, or things around webpage making, these repos found around Github contained many useful items. Among them were images for heroes and other items. Even better was a relational database with IDs that related lower stars heroes with the higher starred ones that they fused into.



The goal is to bring these items into a front-end of sorts, and make it very clear how to run and use the mini app via Flask with Python.
